/* Instruction:
   1.  Complete the requirements based on the 
	   comments.
   2. You are allowed to create additional functions
      to support your answer, but these should be
	  called from the required functions below. 
   3. in.txt contains sample inputs for the program,
      while expected.txt contains the expected result 
	  of your program. Please mind the spacing to 
	  facilitate blackbox testing.  It is suggested
	  that you practice using input and output redirection
	  to help you in debugging.  For example, if your 
	  executable file is exer.exe, for input and output
	  redirection, type:
	     exer < in.txt > actual.txt
	  Then, compare your actual.txt with the provided
	  expected.txt to see if the contents are exactly the same.
   4. It is expected that your code will compile and run.
      A non-compiling program will result to a grade of 0 
	  for this activity. This is so that you hone the habit 
      of completing one function/feature/requirement, making 
	  sure it compiles and executes properly prior to proceeding 
      to the next requirement; to prepare you for the hands-on
	  exams and mp expectations too of having a compiling program.

/* isValidGrade
	This function returns 1 if the value is a valid 
   grade point equivalent.  The possible grade point
   equivalents are 0.0, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 
   and 4.0 only. If invalid, the function returns 0.

   @return int -  1 if value is a valid grade, otherwise 0

}

/* getInputs
	This function gets input from the user as long
   as the user's input is not negative.  Getting of
   input should also stop when the maximum capacity
   of the array is reached. Assume the user will input
   at most 1 decimal place for each input.
   
   If the input is not negative, the function isValidGrade()
   is called to check if the input is a valid grade
   point equivalent.  If yes, this is stored into the array,
   if not, the value should NOT be stored in the array.
   
   @param float aGrades[] - the array where the user input 
                is to be stored
   @return int - the number of non-negative inputs stored 
                in aGrades
				
   Requirements: 1. You are NOT allowed to have any 
                    printf() statements in this function.
				 2. You are required to call isValidGrade()
				    as part of the solution.
